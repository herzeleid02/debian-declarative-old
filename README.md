# debian-declarative

## About
This project tries to reinvent the wheel and make Debian installation declarative. (IaS solution).

This project is proof-of-concept and not meant to be used in any serious manner.

Moreover, this project is tied to [SquashLinux](https://github.com/herzeleid02/squashlinux).

Bootstrapping process is done via extracting OCI containers onto host filesystems, instead of regular bootstrap.

One of the principles for this project is to also eliminate any "jank" in it's core functionality. (its jank already)

11 December 2023, Monday, Week 50 -- im rewriting the project again to use containerfiles to build images more gracefully

## Structuring
`build.sh` is the one you edit -- try to invoke other scrips if possible (i should rename it)

`main.sh` the global and universal basic config -- You should **not** edit this file. This script maintains basic chroot configuration (locale setup, adding apt https repositories, etc, etc) (the main function)

`make.sh` -- "Makefile" for the project. Basically, I reinvented what people usually call a `Dockerfile`.

```
Note: all three share the same their variables
build.sh --> main.sh --> make.sh
```

`functions/` -- Directory with scripts (something similar "playbooks" and "modules" in [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible)). This directory contents should be the same across all branches and you should edit existing files only to fix their functionality, not change or add new. To add new functionality you should create a new script.

To create a new system setup you should:
1) create a new branch
2) add new "functions" in the respective directory if necessary
3) edit build.sh
4) run build.sh

## Global variables for `build.sh`
`image` (OCI image name)

`hostname`

`users` ~~(implying that this project covers single-user installation ðŸ˜–)~~

`apt_packages` (space would be the delimiter)

## Notes
The better thing to do (which i will implement right now as im typing this text) is to edit the running container and only then exporting it.

Why? Because podman manages `/dev/null` and other special files correctly and theres no need to create stuff or mount host `/proc` and other special files and directories. (We should reduce jank to a minimum)

Maybe it should have a single dockerfile (?) (but then how its going to import itself?)

### Reasons against `Containerfile`
You can replace the "make.sh" script with Containerfile and nothing will change but the requirement in having another executable that will remove the temporary image.

**NO ARRAYS**. They are not part of POSIX sh.

About podman images -- i used `--squash` option so that the newly built image has only one layer (tar file when importing it)

Maybe i should just direct import it as a dir :)
