# debian-declarative

## About
This project tries to reinvent the wheel and make Debian installation declarative. (IaS solution).

This project is proof-of-concept and not meant to be used in any serious manner.

Moreover, this project is tied to [SquashLinux](https://github.com/herzeleid02/squashlinux).

Bootstrapping process is done via extracting OCI containers onto host filesystems, instead of regular bootstrap.
